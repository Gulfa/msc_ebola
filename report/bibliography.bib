	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Delays in case reporting are common to disease surveillance systems, making it difficult to track diseases in real-time. "Nowcast" approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission - that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases - and are optimized to a single application, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting package. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package "NobBS") for widespread application.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Amongst confirmed cases, seropositivity increased with age and \&gt;50\% of the adult population had ZIKV antibodies. The duration of immunity to ZIKV remains unclear. We used an agent-based model in a Bayesian framework to describe the dynamics of immunity to ZIKV, and predict the future age-specific risk of ZIKV infection in the population of Managua. We also investigated the potential impact of a ZIKV vaccine under different assumptions about the persistence of immunity. Assuming lifelong immunity, the risk of a ZIKV outbreak will remain low until 2035 and rise above 50\% in 2047. Young women of reproductive age will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV vaccine development and licensure are urgent, to attain the maximum benefit in reducing the population-level risk of infection and the risk of adverse congenital outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The first problem is to identify the shape of the infectious period distribution; the second problem is to determine whether individuals display symptoms before, at the same time, or after they become infectious. In both cases we show that the correct model can be identified, in the majority of cases, from symptom onset data generated from multiple outbreaks in small populations. The method works by evaluating the likelihood using a particle filter that incorporates a novel importance sampling algorithm designed for partially-observed continuous-time Markov chains. This is combined with another importance sampling method to unbiasedly estimate the model evidence to a given precision. Our method is general and can be applied to a wide range of model selection problems in biological and epidemiological systems with intractable likelihood functions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Investigations of food-borne outbreaks are frequently unsuccessful and new investigation methods should be welcomed. Aim: Describe the use of consumer purchase datasets in outbreak investigations and consider methodological and practical difficulties. Methods: We reviewed published papers describing the use of consumer purchase datasets, where electronic data on the foods that case-patients had purchased before onset of symptoms were obtained and analysed as part of outbreak investigations. Results: For the period 2006–17, scientific articles were found describing 20 outbreak investigations. Most outbreaks involved salmonella or Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and were performed in eight different countries. The consumer purchase datasets were most frequently used to generate hypotheses about the outbreak vehicle where case-interviews had not been fruitful. Secondly, they were used to aid trace-back investigation, where a vehicle was already suspected. A number of methodological as well as (in some countries) legal and practical impediments exist. Conclusions: Several of the outbreaks were unlikely to have been solved without the use of consumer purchase datasets. The method is potentially powerful and with future improved access to big data purchase information, may become a widely applicable tool for outbreak investigations, enabling investigators to quickly find hypotheses and at the same time estimate odds ratios or relative risks hereof. We suggest using the term ‘consumer purchase data’ to refer to the approach in the future.},

The Above Local Elevated Respiratory Illness Threshold (ALERT) algorithm uses a threshold-based approach to suggest incidence levels that historically have indicated the transition from endemic to epidemic activity. In this paper, we present the first detailed overview of the computational approach underlying the algorithm. In the motivating example section, we evaluate the performance of ALERT in determining the onset of increased respiratory virus incidence using laboratory testing data from the Children9s Hospital of Colorado. At a threshold of 10 cases per week, ALERT-selected intervention periods performed better than the observed hospital site periods (2004/2005-2012/2013) and a CUSUM method. Additional simulation studies show how data properties may effect ALERT performance on novel data. We found that the conditions under which ALERT showed ideal performance generally included high seasonality and low off-season incidence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It worked in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone across \&gt;12,000 communities (approximately 70\% of all communities), through 2,466 trained Community Mobilizers, a network of 2,000 mosques and churches, and 42 local radio stations.

We present an extensive dataset of community engagement and monitoring with a focus on over 50,000 SMAC weekly reports collected by Community Mobilizers between December 2014 and September 2015. Community engagement and real-time data collection at scale is achievable in the context of a health emergency if adequately structured, managed, coordinated and resourced. We describe a correlation between systemic community engagement, community action planning and Ebola-safe behaviors at community-level. The SMAC integrated approach demonstrates the scope of data - including surveillance data - that can be generated directly by communities through structured community engagement interventions implemented at scale during an Ebola outbreak.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite a very effective vaccine, active conflict and community distrust during the ongoing DRC Ebola epidemic are undermining control efforts, including a ring vaccination strategy that require the prompt immunization of close contacts of infected individuals. However, 20\% or more of close contacts cannot be reached or refused vaccination, and it is predicted that the ring vaccination strategy would not be effective with such a high level of inaccessibility. In May 2019, the DRC expanded their control efforts to include a community vaccine strategy. To assess the impact of vaccination strategies for controlling Ebola epidemics in the context of variable levels of community resistance, we employed an individual-level stochastic transmission model that incorporates three sources of heterogeneity namely a proportion of the population is inaccessible for effective contact tracing and vaccination efforts due to lack of confidence in interventions or geographic inaccessibility, two levels of population mixing resembling household and community transmission, and spatial dependence on transmission rates. Our results indicate that a ring vaccination strategy would not be effective for containing the epidemic if levels of inaccessibility are too high and estimate the impact of a supplemental community vaccination strategy. Our key results are that as levels of inaccessibility increase, there is a qualitative change in the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy. For lower levels of inaccessibility, the probability of epidemic containment increases over time, even if probabilities are lower than they would be otherwise. For higher levels of inaccessibility, vaccination strategies are not expected to contain the epidemic even though they help lower incidence levels, which saves lives, makes the epidemic easier to contain and reduces spread to other communities. This qualitative change occurs for both types of vaccination strategies: ring vaccination is effective for containing an outbreak until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 30\%, a combined ring and community vaccination strategy is effective until the levels of inaccessibility exceeds approximately 50\%. More broadly, our results underscore the need to enhance community engagement to public health interventions in order to enhance the effectiveness of control interventions to ensure outbreak containment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Motivation:Public health authorities can provide more effective and timely interventions to protect populations during health events if they have effective multi-purpose surveillance systems. These systems rely on aberration detection algorithms to identify potential threats within large datasets. Ensuring the algorithms are sensitive, specific and timely is crucial for protecting public health. Here, we evaluate the performance of three detection algorithms extensively used for syndromic surveillance: the 'rising activity, multilevel mixed effects, indicator emphasis' (RAMMIE) method and the improved quasi-Poisson regression-based method known as 'Farrington Flexible' both currently used at Public Health England, and the 'Early Aberration Reporting System' (EARS) method used at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. We model the wide range of data structures encountered within the daily syndromic surveillance systems used by PHE. We undertake extensive simulations to identify which algorithms work best across different types of syndromes and different outbreak sizes. We evaluate RAMMIE for the first time since its introduction. Performance metrics were computed and compared in the presence of a range of simulated outbreak types that were added to baseline data. Results:We conclude that amongst the algorithm variants that have a high specificity (i.e. ¿90\%), Farrington Flexible has the highest sensitivity and specificity, whereas RAMMIE has the highest probability of outbreak detection and is the most timely, typically detecting outbreaks 2-3 days earlier.

Spearman correlation and time series seasonal decomposition were used to assess the relationship between the three surveillance systems and to explore seasonal patterns and characteristics of influenza epidemics in Gansu, China. Our results showed influenza epidemics appeared a single-peak around January in all three surveillance systems.

	abstract = {Benchmarking surveillance systems requires realistic simulations of disease outbreaks. However, obtaining these data in sufficient quantity, with a realistic shape and covering a sufficient range of agents, size and duration, is known to be very difficult. The dataset of outbreak signals generated should reflect the likely distribution of authentic situations faced by the surveillance system, including very unlikely outbreak signals. We propose and evaluate a new approach based on the use of historical outbreak data to simulate tailored outbreak signals. The method relies on a homothetic transformation of the historical distribution followed by resampling processes (Binomial, Inverse Transform Sampling Method—ITSM, Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk, Metropolis-Hasting Independent, Gibbs Sampler, Hybrid Gibbs Sampler). We carried out an analysis to identify the most important input parameters for simulation quality and to evaluate performance for each of the resampling algorithms. Our analysis confirms the influence of the type of algorithm used and simulation parameters (i.e. days, number of cases, outbreak shape, overall scale factor) on the results. We show that, regardless of the outbreaks, algorithms and metrics chosen for the evaluation, simulation quality decreased with the increase in the number of days simulated and increased with the number of cases simulated. Simulating outbreaks with fewer cases than days of duration (i.e. overall scale factor less than 1) resulted in an important loss of information during the simulation. We found that Gibbs sampling with a shrinkage procedure provides a good balance between accuracy and data dependency. If dependency is of little importance, binomial and ITSM methods are accurate. Given the constraint of keeping the simulation within a range of plausible epidemiological curves faced by the surveillance system, our study confirms that our approach can be used to generate a large spectrum of outbreak signals.},

Methods with a high sensitivity (up to 79.5\%) had a low specificity. All methods had a high negative predictive value, over 94\%, while positive predictive values ranged from 6.5\% to 68.4\%. Multivariate Poisson regression models showed that performance measures were strongly influenced by the characteristics of time series. Past or current outbreak size and duration strongly influenced detection performances.},

Here we describe the advantages of such an approach, and the steps taken to set up the Animal Health Surveillance Ontological (AHSO) framework. The AHSO framework is modelled in OWL, the W3C standard Semantic Web language for representing rich and complex knowledge. We illustrate how the framework can incorporate knowledge directly from domain experts or from data-driven sources, as well as by integrating existing mature ontological components from related disciplines.

The method involved three steps: (i) preparation of an outbreak-free historical baseline over 5 years, (ii) simulation of over 100 years of baseline time series with injection of artificial outbreak signals with several shapes, durations and magnitudes, and (iii) assessment of the performance (sensitivity, specificity, outbreak detection precocity) of several algorithms to detect these artificial outbreak signals. The algorithms tested included the Shewart p chart, confidence interval of the negative binomial model, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA); and cumulative sum (CUSUM). The highest sensitivity was obtained using a negative binomial algorithm and the highest specificity with CUSUM or EWMA. EWMA sensitivity was too low to select this algorithm for efficient outbreak detection. CUSUM's performance was complementary to the negative binomial algorithm. The use of both algorithms on real data for a prospective investigation of the whole carcass condemnation rate as a syndromic surveillance indicator could be relevant. Shewart could also be a good option considering its high sensitivity and simplicity of implementation.},

Exotic (n = 49) and re-emerging (n = 27) diseases constituted the most frequently represented health threats. In addition, the majority of studies were related to zoonoses (n = 66). The approaches found in the review could be divided in surveillance modalities, both active (n = 23) and passive (n = 5); and tools and methodologies that support surveillance activities (n = 57). Combinations of surveillance modalities and tools (n = 40) were also found. Risk-based approaches were very common (n = 60), especially in the papers describing tools and methodologies (n = 50). The main applications, benefits and limitations of each approach were extracted from the papers. This information will be very useful for informing the development of tools to facilitate the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies.

Methods This work combines three algorithms that have demonstrated solid performance in detecting simulated outbreak signals of varying shapes in time series of laboratory submissions counts. These are: the Shewhart control charts designed to detect sudden spikes in counts; the EWMA control charts developed to detect slow increasing outbreaks; and the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, which can explicitly account for temporal effects in the data stream monitored. A scoring system to detect and report alarms using these algorithms in a complementary way is proposed. Results The use of multiple algorithms in parallel resulted in increased system sensitivity. Specificity was decreased in simulated data, but the number of false alarms per year when the approach was applied to real data was considered manageable (between 1 and 3 per year for each of ten syndromic groups monitored). The automated implementation of this approach, including a method for on-line filtering of potential outbreak signals is described. Conclusion The developed system provides high sensitivity for detection of potential outbreak signals while also providing robustness and flexibility in establishing what signals constitute an alarm. This flexibility allows an analyst to customize the system for different syndromes.},

	abstract = {The practice of disease surveillance has shifted in the last two decades towards the introduction of systems capable of early detection of disease. Modern biosurveillance systems explore different sources of pre-diagnostic data, such as patient's chief complaint upon emergency visit or laboratory test orders. These sources of data can provide more rapid detection than traditional surveillance based on case confirmation, but are less specific, and therefore their use poses challenges related to the presence of background noise and unlabelled temporal aberrations in historical data. The overall goal of this study was to carry out retrospective analysis using three years of laboratory test submissions to the Animal Health Laboratory in the province of Ontario, Canada, in order to prepare the data for use in syndromic surveillance. Daily cases were grouped into syndromes and counts for each syndrome were monitored on a daily basis when medians were higher than one case per day, and weekly otherwise. Poisson regression accounting for day-of-week and month was able to capture the day-of-week effect with minimal influence from temporal aberrations. Applying Poisson regression in an iterative manner, that removed data points above the predicted 95th percentile of daily counts, allowed for the removal of these aberrations in the absence of labelled outbreaks, while maintaining the day-of-week effect that was present in the original data. This resulted in the construction of time series that represent the baseline patterns over the past three years, free of temporal aberrations. The final method was thus able to remove temporal aberrations while keeping the original explainable effects in the data, did not need a training period free of aberrations, had minimal adjustment to the aberrations present in the raw data, and did not require labelled outbreaks. Moreover, it was readily applicable to the weekly data by substituting Poisson regression with moving 95th percentiles.},

Peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in order to identify surveillance systems that explicitly address outbreak detection based on systematic monitoring of animal population data, in any phase of implementation. The review found that developments in veterinary syndromic surveillance are focused not only on animal health, but also on the use of animals as sentinels for public health, representing a further step towards One Medicine. The main sources of information are clinical data from practitioners and laboratory data, but a number of other sources are being explored. Due to limitations inherent in the way data on animal health is collected, the development of veterinary syndromic surveillance initially focused on animal health data collection strategies, analyzing historical data for their potential to support systematic monitoring, or solving problems of data classification and integration. Systems based on passive notification or data transfers are now dealing with sustainability issues. Given the ongoing barriers in availability of data, diagnostic laboratories appear to provide the most readily available data sources for syndromic surveillance in animal health. As the bottlenecks around data source availability are overcome, the next challenge is consolidating data standards for data classification, promoting the integration of different animal health surveillance systems, and also the integration to public health surveillance. Moreover, the outputs of systems for systematic monitoring of animal health data must be directly connected to real-time decision support systems which are increasingly being used for disease management and control.},

	abstract = {Background
In an era of ubiquitous electronic collection of animal health data, multivariate surveillance systems (which concurrently monitor several data streams) should have a greater probability of detecting disease events than univariate systems. However, despite their limitations, univariate aberration detection algorithms are used in most active syndromic surveillance (SyS) systems because of their ease of application and interpretation. On the other hand, a stochastic modelling-based approach to multivariate surveillance offers more flexibility, allowing for the retention of historical outbreaks, for overdispersion and for non-stationarity. While such methods are not new, they are yet to be applied to animal health surveillance data. We applied an example of such stochastic model, Held and colleagues’ two-component model, to two multivariate animal health datasets from Switzerland.

Results
In our first application, multivariate time series of the number of laboratories test requests were derived from Swiss animal diagnostic laboratories. We compare the performance of the two-component model to parallel monitoring using an improved Farrington algorithm and found both methods yield a satisfactorily low false alarm rate. However, the calibration test of the two-component model on the one-step ahead predictions proved satisfactory, making such an approach suitable for outbreak prediction. In our second application, the two-component model was applied to the multivariate time series of the number of cattle abortions and the number of test requests for bovine viral diarrhea (a disease that often results in abortions). We found that there is a two days lagged effect from the number of abortions to the number of test requests. We further compared the joint modelling and univariate modelling of the number of laboratory test requests time series. The joint modelling approach showed evidence of superiority in terms of forecasting abilities.

Conclusions
Stochastic modelling approaches offer the potential to address more realistic surveillance scenarios through, for example, the inclusion of times series specific parameters, or of covariates known to have an impact on syndrome counts. Nevertheless, many methodological challenges to multivariate surveillance of animal SyS data still remain. Deciding on the amount of corroboration among data streams that is required to escalate into an alert is not a trivial task given the sparse data on the events under consideration (e.g. disease outbreaks).},

So far, methodology in this area has been largely of frequentist nature and has increasingly been taking inspiration from statistical process control. The present work is concerned with strengthening Bayesian thinking in this field. We extend the widely used approach of Farrington et al. and Heisterkamp et al. to a modern Bayesian framework within a time series decomposition context. This approach facilitates a direct calculation of the decision-making threshold while taking all sources of uncertainty in both prediction and estimation into account. More importantly, with the methodology it is now also possible to integrate covariate processes, e.g. weather influence, into the outbreak detection. Model inference is performed using fast and efficient integrated nested Laplace approximations, enabling the use of this method in routine surveillance at public health institutions. Performance of the algorithm was investigated by comparing simulations with existing methods as well as by analysing the time series of notified campylobacteriosis cases in Germany for the years 2002–2011, which include absolute humidity as a covariate process. Altogether, a flexible and modern surveillance algorithm is presented with an implementation available through the R package ‘surveillance’.},

In its simplest form, the model can be seen as a Poisson branching process model with immigration. Extensions to include seasonal effects, time trends and overdispersion are outlined. The model is shown to provide an adequate fit and reliable one-step-ahead prediction intervals for a typical infectious disease time series. In addition, a multivariate formulation is proposed, which is well suited to capture space-time dependence caused by the spatial spread of a disease over time. An analysis of two multivariate time series is described. All analyses have been done using general optimization routines, where ML estimates and corresponding standard errors are readily available.},

Increasingly, surveillance systems are capturing spatial and temporal data on disease and health outcomes in a variety of public health contexts. A vast and growing suite of methods exists for detection of outbreaks and trends in surveillance data and the selection of appropriate methods in a given surveillance context is not always clear. While most reviews of methods focus on algorithm performance, in practice, a variety of factors determine what methods are appropriate for surveillance. In this review, we focus on the role of contextual factors such as scale, scope, surveillance objective, disease characteristics, and technical issues in relation to commonly used approaches to surveillance. Methods are classified as testing-based or model-based approaches. Reviewing methods in the context of factors other than algorithm performance highlights important aspects of implementing and selecting appropriate disease surveillance methods.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and unbiasedness of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time in Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but models were increasingly inaccurate at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making requiring predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The world is continuously urbanising, resulting in clusters of densely populated urban areas and more sparsely populated rural areas. We propose a method for generating spatial fields with controllable levels of clustering of the population. We build a synthetic country, and use this method to generate versions of the country with different clustering levels. Combined with a metapopulation model for infectious disease spread, this allows us to in silico explore how urbanisation affects infectious disease spread. In a baseline scenario with no interventions, the underlying population clustering seems to have little effect on the final size and timing of the epidemic. Under within-country restrictions on non-commuting travel, the final size decreases with increased population clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing the final size is larger with higher clustering. The reduction is larger in the more rural areas. Within-country travel restrictions delay the epidemic, and the delay is largest for lower clustering levels. We implemented three different vaccination strategies—uniform vaccination (in space), preferentially vaccinating urban locations and preferentially vaccinating rural locations. The urban and uniform vaccination strategies were most effective in reducing the final size, while the rural vaccination strategy was clearly inferior. Visual inspection of some European countries shows that many countries already have high population clustering. In the future, they will likely become even more clustered. Hence, according to our model, within-country travel restrictions are likely to be less and less effective in delaying epidemics, while they will be more effective in decreasing final sizes. In addition, to minimise final sizes, it is important not to neglect urban locations when distributing vaccines. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the effect of urbanisation on infectious disease spread and in particular, to examine effectiveness of prevention measures as a function of urbanisation.},

A new analysis of outbreak data shows that individual differences in infectiousness exert powerful influences on the epidemiology of ten deadly diseases. SARS and measles (and perhaps avian influenza) show strong tendencies towards ‘superspreading events’ that can ignite explosive epidemics — but this same volatility makes outbreaks more likely to fizzle out. Smallpox and pneumonic plague, two potential bioterrorism agents, show steadier growth but still differ markedly from the traditional average-based view.

The rising prevalence of MRSA in the community implies more frequent introductions in healthcare settings that could jeopardize the effectiveness of infection-control procedures. To investigate the epidemiological dynamics of MRSA in a low-prevalence country, we developed an individual-based model (IBM) reproducing the population’s sociodemography, explicitly representing households, hospitals, and nursing homes. The model was calibrated to surveillance data from the Norwegian national registry (2008–2015) and to published household prevalence data. We estimated an effective reproductive number of 0.68 (95\% CI 0.47–0.90), suggesting that the observed rise in MRSA infections is not due to an ongoing epidemic but driven by more frequent acquisitions abroad. As a result of MRSA importations, an almost twofold increase in the prevalence of carriage was estimated over the study period, in 2015 reaching a value of 0.37\% (0.25–0.54\%) in the community and 1.11\% (0.79–1.59\%) in hospitalized patients. Household transmission accounted for half of new MRSA acquisitions, indicating this setting as a potential target for preventive strategies. However, nosocomial acquisition was still the primary source of symptomatic disease, which reinforces the importance of hospital-based transmission control. Although our results indicate little reason for concern about MRSA transmission in low-prevalence settings in the immediate future, the increases in importation and global circulation highlight the need for coordinated initiatives to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide.

As a result of MRSA importations, an almost twofold increase in the prevalence of carriage was estimated over the study period, in 2015 reaching a value of 0.37\% (0.25–0.54\%) in the community and 1.11\% (0.79–1.59\%) in hospitalized patients. Household transmission accounted for half of new MRSA acquisitions, indicating this setting as a potential target for preventive strategies. However, nosocomial acquisition was still the primary source of symptomatic disease, which reinforces the importance of hospital-based transmission control. Although our results indicate little reason for concern about MRSA transmission in low-prevalence settings in the immediate future, the increases in importation and global circulation highlight the need for coordinated initiatives to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide.},

Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1002170},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ongoing West African Ebola epidemic began in December 2013 in Guinea, probably from a single zoonotic introduction. As a result of ineffective initial control efforts, an Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scale emerged. As of 4 May 2015, it had resulted in more than 19,000 probable and confirmed Ebola cases, mainly in Guinea (3,529), Liberia (5,343), and Sierra Leone (10,746). Here, we present analyses of data collected during the outbreak identifying drivers of transmission and highlighting areas where control could be improved.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Over 19,000 confirmed and probable Ebola cases were reported in West Africa by 4 May 2015. Individuals with confirmed or probable Ebola ("cases") were asked if they had exposure to other potential Ebola cases ("potential source contacts") in a funeral or non-funeral context prior to becoming ill. We performed retrospective analyses of a case line-list, collated from national databases of case investigation forms that have been reported to WHO. These analyses were initially performed to assist WHO's response during the epidemic, and have been updated for publication. We analysed data from 3,529 cases in Guinea, 5,343 in Liberia, and 10,746 in Sierra Leone; exposures were reported by 33\% of cases. The proportion of cases reporting a funeral exposure decreased over time. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.35, p {\textless} 0.001) between this proportion in a given district for a given month and the within-district transmission intensity, quantified by the estimated reproduction number (R). We also found a negative correlation (r = -0.37, p {\textless} 0.001) between R and the district proportion of hospitalised cases admitted within ≤4 days of symptom onset. These two proportions were not correlated, suggesting that reduced funeral attendance and faster hospitalisation independently influenced local transmission intensity. We were able to identify 14\% of potential source contacts as cases in the case line-list. Linking cases to the contacts who potentially infected them provided information on the transmission network. This revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in inferred transmissions, with only 20\% of cases accounting for at least 73\% of new infections, a phenomenon often called super-spreading. Multivariable regression models allowed us to identify predictors of being named as a potential source contact. These were similar for funeral and non-funeral contacts: severe symptoms, death, non-hospitalisation, older age, and travelling prior to symptom onset. Non-funeral exposures were strongly peaked around the death of the contact. There was evidence that hospitalisation reduced but did not eliminate onward exposures. We found that Ebola treatment units were better than other health care facilities at preventing exposure from hospitalised and deceased individuals. The principal limitation of our analysis is limited data quality, with cases not being entered into the database, cases not reporting exposures, or data being entered incorrectly (especially dates, and possible misclassifications).
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving elimination of Ebola is challenging, partly because of super-spreading. Safe funeral practices and fast hospitalisation contributed to the containment of this Ebola epidemic. Continued real-time data capture, reporting, and analysis are vital to track transmission patterns, inform resource deployment, and thus hasten and maintain elimination of the virus from the human population.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a viral haemorrhagic fever with high mortality that has caused a number of severe outbreaks in Central and West Africa. Although the majority previous outbreaks have been relatively small, the result of managing outbreaks places huge strains on already limited resources. Mathematical models matched to early case reporting data can be used to identify outbreaks that are at high risk of spreading. Here we consider the EVD outbreak in Equateur Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was declared on 8 May 2018. We use a simple stochastic metapopulation model to capture the dynamics in the three affected health zones: Bikoro, Iboko and Wangata. We are able to rapidly simulate a large number of realisations and use approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free method, to determine parameters by matching between reported and simulated cases. This method has a number of advantages over more traditional likelihood-based methods as it is less sensitive to errors in the data and is a natural extension to the prediction framework. Using data from 8 to 25 May 2018 we are able to capture the exponential increases in the number of cases in three locations (Bikoro, Iboko and Wangata), although our estimated basic reproductive ratio is higher than for previous outbreaks. Using additional data until 08 July 2018 we are able to detect a decrease in transmission such that the reproductive ratio falls below one. We also estimate the probability of transmission to Kinshasa. We believe this method of fitting models to data offers a generic approach that can deliver rapid results in real time during a range of future outbreaks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
Dengue virus importation from abroad is still the main driver of dengue incidence in China. Using global flight data to model importation may improve our understanding and prediction of dengue virus importation and onward transmission.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed of surveillance cases of dengue infections imported to China and volume of air traffic to China for the years 2005 through 2014, inclusive. The data were aggregated by year, destination province, and source country. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and a random effects negative binomial model was created to predict the number of imported cases based on the volume of travelers from dengue-endemic countries.
Results
There were 1,822 cases of imported dengue infections over the study period. Most imported cases are from a small number of high-incidence countries with a large volume of travel to China, most notably Myanmar (22\% of cases). The number of imported cases of dengue infections increased by 5.9\% for every 10\% increase in travel volume from dengue-endemic countries.
Conclusion
Patterns of air travel have a measurable impact on the importation of dengue to China. Modelling dengue importation risk may be a useful strategy to direct public health surveillance and interventions.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
To end the global tuberculosis epidemic, latent tuberculosis infection needs to be addressed. All standard treatments for latent tuberculosis contain drugs to which multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant. We aimed to estimate the global burden of multidrug-resistant latent tuberculosis infection to inform tuberculosis elimination policy.
Methods
By fitting a flexible statistical model to tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance and survey data collated by WHO, we estimated national trends in the proportion of new tuberculosis cases that were caused by MDR strains. We used these data as a proxy for the proportion of new infections caused by MDR M tuberculosis and multiplied trends in annual risk of infection from previous estimates of the burden of latent tuberculosis to generate trends in the annual risk of infection with MDR M tuberculosis. These estimates were used in a cohort model to estimate changes in the global and national prevalence of latent infection with MDR M tuberculosis. We also estimated recent infection levels (ie, in 2013 and 2014) and made predictions for the future burden of MDR tuberculosis in 2035 and 2050.
Findings
19·1 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 16·4 million–21·7 million) people were latently infected with MDR tuberculosis in 2014—a global prevalence of 0·3\% (95\% UI 0·2–0·3). MDR strains accounted for 1·2\% (95\% UI 1·0–1·4) of the total latent tuberculosis burden overall, but for 2·9\% (95\% UI 2·6–3·1) of the burden among children younger than 15 years (risk ratio for those younger than 15 years vs those aged 15 years or older 2·65 [95\% UI 2·11–3·25]). Recent latent infection with MDR M tuberculosis meant that 1·9 million (95\% UI 1·7 million–2·3 million) people globally were at high risk of active MDR tuberculosis in 2015.
Interpretation
We estimate that three in every 1000 people globally carry latent MDR tuberculosis infection, and prevalence is around ten times higher among those younger than 15 years. If current trends continue, the proportion of latent tuberculosis caused by MDR strains will increase, which will pose serious challenges for management of latent tuberculosis—a cornerstone of tuberculosis elimination strategies.

In this article, we generalize previous models by studying an SIR epidemic model with a nonlinear incidence rate, saturated Holling type II treatment rate, and logistic growth. We compute the basic reproduction number and determine conditions for the local stability of equilibria and the existence of backward bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. We also show that, when the disease transmission rate and treatment parameter are varied, our model undergoes a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 or 3. Simulations of the solutions and numerical continuation of equilibria are carried out to generate 2D and 3D bifurcation diagrams, as well as several related phase portraits that illustrate our results. Our work shows that incorporating these factors into epidemic models can lead to very complex dynamics.},

From a public health perspective, forecasts of infectious disease spread are of central importance. We argue that such forecasts need to properly incorporate the attached uncertainty, so they should be probabilistic in nature. However, forecasts also need to take into account temporal dependencies inherent to communicable diseases, spatial dynamics through human travel and social contact patterns between age groups. We describe a multivariate time series model for weekly surveillance counts on norovirus gastroenteritis from the 12 city districts of Berlin, in six age groups, from week 2011/27 to week 2015/26. The following year (2015/27 to 2016/26) is used to assess the quality of the predictions. Probabilistic forecasts of the total number of cases can be derived through Monte Carlo simulation, but first and second moments are also available analytically. Final size forecasts as well as multivariate forecasts of the total number of cases by age group, by district and by week are compared across different models of varying complexity.

	abstract = {Background Measures of the contribution of influenza to Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, both in the seasonal and pandemic setting, are needed to predict the burden of secondary bacterial infections in future pandemics to inform stockpiling. The magnitude of the interaction between these two pathogens has been difficult to quantify because both infections are mainly clinically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms; a combined viral–bacterial testing is rarely performed in routine clinical practice; and surveillance data suffer from confounding problems common to all ecological studies. We proposed a novel multivariate model for age-stratified disease incidence, incorporating contact patterns and estimating disease transmission within and across groups. Methods and findings We used surveillance data from England over the years 2009 to 2017. Influenza infections were identified through the virological testing of samples taken from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness (ILI) within the sentinel scheme run by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases were routinely reported to Public Health England (PHE) by all the microbiology laboratories included in the national surveillance system. IPD counts at week t, conditional on the previous time point t−1, were assumed to be negative binomially distributed. Influenza counts were linearly included in the model for the mean IPD counts along with an endemic component describing some seasonal background and an autoregressive component mimicking pneumococcal transmission. Using age-specific counts, Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based model selection suggested that the best fit was obtained when the endemic component was expressed as a function of observed temperature and rainfall. Pneumococcal transmission within the same age group was estimated to explain 33.0\% (confidence interval [CI] 24.9\%–39.9\%) of new cases in the elderly, whereas 50.7\% (CI 38.8\%–63.2\%) of incidence in adults aged 15–44 years was attributed to transmission from another age group. The contribution of influenza on IPD during the 2009 pandemic also appeared to vary greatly across subgroups, being highest in school-age children and adults (18.3\%, CI 9.4\%–28.2\%, and 6.07\%, CI 2.83\%–9.76\%, respectively). Other viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, also seemed to have an impact on IPD: RSV contributed 1.87\% (CI 0.89\%–3.08\%) to pneumococcal infections in the 65+ group, whereas 2.14\% (CI 0.87\%–3.57\%) of cases in the group of 45- to 64-year-olds were attributed to rhinovirus. The validity of this modelling strategy relies on the assumption that viral surveillance adequately represents the true incidence of influenza in the population, whereas the small numbers of IPD cases observed in the younger age groups led to significant uncertainty around some parameter estimates. Conclusions Our estimates suggested that a pandemic wave of influenza A/H1N1 with comparable severity to the 2009 pandemic could have a modest impact on school-age children and adults in terms of IPD and a small to negligible impact on infants and the elderly. The seasonal impact of other viruses such as RSV and rhinovirus was instead more important in the older population groups.},

	abstract = {Objective
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a serious public health issue in many countries; however, its transmissibility in county-level outbreaks remains unclear. The aim of this study is to estimate the transmissibility of HFMD epidemics on both city level and county level, for a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of HFMD epidemics.
Study design
Simulation based on data obtained from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention.
Methods
The weekly number of reported HFMD cases from April 2009 to December 2017 in nine regions of Changsha City was collected. A susceptible-infectious-recovered model was used to estimate the transmissibility of HFMD. The reproduction number of reported cases during the ascending (denoted as Rasc) and descending (denoted as Rdes) period was used to describe the transmissibility of HFMD.
Results
The Rasc and Rdes for HFMD in Changsha was 1.44 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41–1.48) and 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.69–0.73), respectively. There was no statistical significance of Rasc values among nine regions (F = 1.056, P = 0.396), nor of Rdes values among nine regions (F = 1.676, P = 0.106). The average Rasc (1.53, 95\% CI: 1.46–1.61) from 2009 to 2012 was higher than the one (1.37, 95\% CI: 1.34–1.40) from 2013 to 2017 (t = 3.974, P {\textless} 0.001), but the average Rdes (0.67, 95\% CI: 0.63–0.70) from 2009 to 2012 was lower than the one (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.73–0.76) from 2013 to 2017 (t = −3.751, P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
The epidemic of HFMD in Changsha City is still grim, and integrated strategies should be taken for controlling and preventing HFMD.},

	abstract = {Understanding age-group dynamics of infectious diseases is a fundamental issue for both scientific study and policymaking. Age-structure epidemic models were developed in order to study and improve our understanding of these dynamics. By fitting the models to incidence data of real outbreaks one can infer estimates of key epidemiological parameters. However, estimation of the transmission in an age-structured populations requires first to define the age-groups of interest. Misspecification in representing the heterogeneity in the age-dependent transmission rates can potentially lead to biased estimation of parameters. We develop the first statistical, data-driven methodology for deciding on the best partition of incidence data into age-groups. The method employs a top-down hierarchical clustering algorithm, with a metric distance built for maximizing mathematical identifiability of the transmission matrix, and a stopping criteria based on significance testing. The methodology is tested using simulations showing good statistical properties. The methodology is then applied to influenza incidence data of 14 seasons in order to extract the significant age-group clusters in each season.},

	abstract = {A new generation of surveillance strategies is being developed to help detect emerging infections and to identify the increased risks of infectious disease outbreaks that are expected to occur with climate change. These surveillance strategies include event-based surveillance (EBS) systems and risk modelling. The EBS systems use open-source internet data, such as media reports, official reports, and social media (such as Twitter) to detect evidence of an emerging threat, and can be used in conjunction with conventional surveillance systems to enhance early warning of public health threats. More recently, EBS systems include artificial intelligence applications such machine learning and natural language processing to increase the speed, capacity and accuracy of filtering, classifying and analysing health-related internet data. Risk modelling uses statistical and mathematical methods to assess the severity of disease emergence and spread given factors about the host (e.g. number of reported cases), pathogen (e.g. pathogenicity) and environment (e.g. climate suitability for reservoir populations). The types of data in these models are expanding to include health-related information from open-source internet data and information on mobility patterns of humans and goods. This information is helping to identify susceptible populations and predict the pathways from which infections might spread into new areas and new countries. As a powerful addition to traditional surveillance strategies that identify what has already happened, it is anticipated that EBS systems and risk modelling will increasingly be used to inform public health actions to prevent, detect and mitigate the climate change increases in infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {As of June 16, 2019, an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has led to 2136 reported cases in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). As this outbreak continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of people already suffering from civil strife and armed conflict, relatively simple mathematical models and their short-term predictions have the potential to inform Ebola response efforts in real time. We applied recently developed non-parametrically estimated Hawkes point processes to model the expected cumulative case count using daily case counts from May 3, 2018, to June 16, 2019, initially reported by the Ministry of Health of DRC and later confirmed in World Health Organization situation reports. We generated probabilistic estimates of the ongoing EVD outbreak in DRC extending both before and after June 16, 2019, and evaluated their accuracy by comparing forecasted vs. actual outbreak sizes, out-of-sample log-likelihood scores and the error per day in the median forecast. The median estimated outbreak sizes for the prospective thee-, six-, and nine-week projections made using data up to June 16, 2019, were, respectively, 2317 (95\% PI: 2222, 2464); 2440 (95\% PI: 2250, 2790); and 2544 (95\% PI: 2273, 3205). The nine-week projection experienced some degradation with a daily error in the median forecast of 6.73 cases, while the six- and three-week projections were more reliable, with corresponding errors of 4.96 and 4.85 cases per day, respectively. Our findings suggest the Hawkes point process may serve as an easily-applied statistical model to predict EVD outbreak trajectories in near real-time to better inform decision-making and resource allocation during Ebola response efforts.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists use a variety of statistical algorithms for the early detection of outbreaks. The practical usefulness of such methods highly depends on the trade-off between the detection rate of outbreaks and the chances of raising a false alarm. Recent research has shown that the use of machine learning for the fusion of multiple statistical algorithms improves outbreak detection. Instead of relying only on the binary output (alarm or no alarm) of the statistical algorithms, we propose to make use of their p-values for training a fusion classifier. In addition, we also show that adding additional features and adapting the labeling of an epidemic period may further improve performance. For comparison and evaluation, a new measure is introduced which captures the performance of an outbreak detection method with respect to a low rate of false alarms more precisely than previous works. Our results on synthetic data show that it is challenging to improve the performance with a trainable fusion method based on machine learning. In particular, the use of a fusion classifier that is only based on binary outputs of the statistical surveillance methods can make the overall performance worse than directly using the underlying algorithms. However, the use of p-values and additional information for the learning is promising, enabling to identify more valuable patterns to detect outbreaks.},

	abstract = {We investigate the use of Twitter data to deliver signals for syndromic surveillance in order to assess its ability to augment existing syndromic surveillance efforts and give a better understanding of symptomatic people who do not seek healthcare advice directly. We focus on a specific syndrome—asthma/difficulty breathing. We outline data collection using the Twitter streaming API as well as analysis and pre-processing of the collected data. Even with keyword-based data collection, many of the tweets collected are not be relevant because they represent chatter, or talk of awareness instead of an individual suffering a particular condition. In light of this, we set out to identify relevant tweets to collect a strong and reliable signal. For this, we investigate text classification techniques, and in particular we focus on semi-supervised classification techniques since they enable us to use more of the Twitter data collected while only doing very minimal labelling. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach to symptomatic tweet classification and relevance filtering. We also propose alternative techniques to popular deep learning approaches. Additionally, we highlight the use of emojis and other special features capturing the tweet’s tone to improve the classification performance. Our results show that negative emojis and those that denote laughter provide the best classification performance in conjunction with a simple word-level n-gram approach. We obtain good performance in classifying symptomatic tweets with both supervised and semi-supervised algorithms and found that the proposed semi-supervised algorithms preserve more of the relevant tweets and may be advantageous in the context of a weak signal. Finally, we found some correlation (r = 0.414, p = 0.0004) between the Twitter signal generated with the semi-supervised system and data from consultations for related health conditions.},

	abstract = {The surveillance of infectious diseases relies on the identification of dynamic relations between the infectious diseases and corresponding influencing factors. However, the identification task confronts with two practical challenges: small sample size and delayed effect. To overcome both challenges to imporve the identification results, this study evaluated the performance of dynamic Bayesian network(DBN) in infectious diseases surveillance. Specifically, the evaluation was conducted by two simulations. The first simulation was to evaluate the performance of DBN by comparing it with the Granger causality test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method; and the second simulation was to assess how the DBN could improve the forecasting ability of infectious diseases. In order to make both simulations close to the real-world situation as much as possible, their simulation scenarios were adapted from real-world studies, and practical issues such as nonlinearity and nuisance variables were also considered. The main simulation results were: ① When the sample size was large (n = 340), the true positive rates (TPRs) of DBN (≥98\%) were slightly higher than those of the Granger causality method and approximately the same as those of the LASSO method; the false positive rates (FPRs) of DBN were averagely 46\% less than those of the Granger causality test, and 22\% less than those of the LASSO method. ② When the sample size was small, the main problem was low TPR, which would be further aggravated by the issues of nonlinearity and nuisance variables. In the worst situation (i.e., small sample size, nonlinearity and existence of nuisance variables), the TPR of DBN declined to 43.30\%. However, it was worth noting that such decline could also be found in the corresponding results of Granger causality test and LASSO method. ③ Sample size was important for identifying the dynamic relations among multiple variables, in this case, at least three years of weekly historical data were needed to guarantee the quality of infectious diseases surveillance. ④ DBN could improve the foresting results through reducing forecasting errors by 7\%. According to the above results, DBN is recommended to improve the quality of infectious diseases surveillance.},

In this paper, we study a time-periodic two-strain SIS epidemic model with diffusion and latent period. We first define the basic reproduction number R0i and introduce the invasion number Rˆ0i for each strain i(i=1,2), which can determine the ability of each strain to invade the other single-strain. The main question that we investigate is the threshold dynamics of the model. It is shown that if R0i⩽1(i=1,2), then the disease-free periodic solution is globally attractive; if R0i{\textgreater}1⩾R0j(i≠j,i,j=1,2), then competitive exclusion, where the jth strain dies out and the ith strain persists, is a possible outcome; and if Rˆ0i{\textgreater}1(i=1,2), then the disease persists uniformly. Finally we present the basic framework of threshold dynamics of the system by using numerical simulations, some of which are different from that of the corresponding multi-strain SIS ODE models.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of sexually transmitted disease (STD) aim to represent sexual contact networks, pathogen characteristics, and intervention activities, helping understand and quantify STD epidemics and their control. Models are, unfortunately, necessary because non-linear infectious disease dynamics combined with many interacting variables undermines intuitive understanding. It is hoped that rational decision makers will include a range of evidence, including the finding of models, in funding, planning, implementing, and evaluating STD interventions and programs. The level of detailed required for informative models that can lead to better decisions, and how models can best be included in the international, national, and local public health ecosystem are areas for attention. Questions to consider are: 1) The pros and cons of focusing resources on sub-groups within a population. This is influenced by the biology and behavior associated with the STD, along with structural context. 2) How to ensure successful implementation of interventions? Here simple cascades are being used to identify gaps in treatment and prevention. 3) What is the relative value of developing, introducing and scaling the use of specific testing, treatment and prevention products in STD programs? The epidemiological context and coverage of other interventions have profound implications here. 4) How do we design a surveillance system that provides timely and actionable data on STD epidemiology? Here again the epidemiological context matters. The history of modeling STDs provides many examples that address such questions, and models are currently influencing policy, particularly in HIV programs. However, the development and validation of models in STD epidemiology has been hampered by our inability to directly measure the sexual network via which STDs spread. Recent efforts to evaluate model performance, and advances in pathogen sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, provide avenues to improve the validity and utility of STD models as their use becomes more systematic.

	abstract = {Surveillance of diseases in Kenya is currently carried out by both human and animal health sectors. However, a recent evaluation highlighted the lack of integration between these sectors, leading to disease under-reporting and inefficiencies. This project aimed to develop an integrated and cost-effective surveillance and reporting system for fifteen zoonotic diseases piloted in the counties of Bungoma, Busia and Kakamega in western Kenya. Specifically, in this paper we describe the operational aspects of such a surveillance system. Interviews were carried out with key informants, and this was followed by field visits to identify sentinel sites and liaise with relevant stakeholders. Based on this information, a sampling strategy comprising 12 sentinel sites, 4 in each county, was developed. Each sentinel site comprised of a livestock market, 1-2 neighbouring slaughter houses/slabs, and a hospital in the vicinity; each of the 12 sites, was visited every 4 weeks for 20 cycles. At each site, animal or patient sampling included a clinical examination and collection of blood, faeces and nasal swabs; in slaughtered animals, mesenteric lymph nodes, hydatid cysts and flukes were also collected. At the end of each field visit, data on staff involved and challenges encountered were recorded, while biological samples were processed and tested for 15 zoonotic diseases in the field laboratory in Busia, Kenya. Public engagement sessions were held at each sentinel site to share preliminary results and provide feedback to both stakeholders and study participants. A livestock market visit lasted just over three hours, and the most common challenge was the frequent refusals of animal owners to participate in the study. At the slaughterhouses, visits lasted just under four hours, and challenges included poorly engaged meat inspectors or slaughter processes that were too quick for sampling. Finally, the hospital visits lasted around four hours, and the most frequent challenges included low patients turn-out, frequent staff turn-over leading to poor institutional memory, and difficulty in obtaining patient stool samples. Our experiences have highlighted the importance of engaging with local stakeholders in the field, while also providing timely feedback through public engagement sessions, to ensure on-going compliance.},

	abstract = {Sri Lanka is progressing towards its goal of eliminating human rabies. This goal rests on programs designed to limit canine rabies, which in turn requires a combination of targeted dog rabies control and a better understanding of the movement of the virus between domestic animals, people, and wildlife. Coordinated and integrated surveillance of the disease between human and animal health sectors underpins successful rabies elimination. Our objective was to review surveillance data from 2005 to 2014 to assemble the first multispecies synthesis of rabies information in Sri Lanka and, in doing so, assess needs and opportunities for a One Health approach to rabies surveillance in the country. Our descriptive epidemiological findings were consistent with other studies showing a decline in human cases, endemic and unchanging numbers of dog cases, a relationship between human density and the occurrence of human and animal cases, and significant gaps in understanding trends in rabies incidences in livestock and wildlife. Assessing the trends in the data from the three government organizations responsible for rabies surveillance was difficult due to lack of information on animal population sizes, unquantified sampling biases due to inequities in access to diagnostic capacities, regulatory and administrative barriers, and a continued reliance on clinical means to establish a diagnosis. The information required for a comprehensive rabies control programme was not standardized or consistent, was not in one place, showed significant gaps in completeness, and was not amenable to routine and rapid analysis. Achieving rabies elimination in Sri Lanka would benefit from harmonization of diagnostic and information management standards across animal and human health sectors as well as equitable access to diagnostic capacity for all regions and species.},

We introduce simulated outbreaks of different shapes and magnitudes into the historical data, and compare the detection sensitivity and timeliness of the multi-syndrome detection method with those of uni-syndrome. We find that the multi-syndrome detection framework provides a powerful tool for identifying such designated abnormalities in the data and significantly improves upon the detection sensitivity and timeliness of uni-syndrome analysis. The proposed multivariate framework requires minimal preprocessing of the data and can be easily adopted in settings where temporal information on multiple syndromes are routinely collected and processed, and thus can be an integral component of real-time surveillance systems.

	abstract = {Benchmarking surveillance systems requires realistic simulations of disease outbreaks. However, obtaining these data in sufficient quantity, with a realistic shape and covering a sufficient range of agents, size and duration, is known to be very difficult. The dataset of outbreak signals generated should reflect the likely distribution of authentic situations faced by the surveillance system, including very unlikely outbreak signals. We propose and evaluate a new approach based on the use of historical outbreak data to simulate tailored outbreak signals. The method relies on a homothetic transformation of the historical distribution followed by resampling processes (Binomial, Inverse Transform Sampling Method—ITSM, Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk, Metropolis-Hasting Independent, Gibbs Sampler, Hybrid Gibbs Sampler). We carried out an analysis to identify the most important input parameters for simulation quality and to evaluate performance for each of the resampling algorithms. Our analysis confirms the influence of the type of algorithm used and simulation parameters (i.e. days, number of cases, outbreak shape, overall scale factor) on the results. We show that, regardless of the outbreaks, algorithms and metrics chosen for the evaluation, simulation quality decreased with the increase in the number of days simulated and increased with the number of cases simulated. Simulating outbreaks with fewer cases than days of duration (i.e. overall scale factor less than 1) resulted in an important loss of information during the simulation. We found that Gibbs sampling with a shrinkage procedure provides a good balance between accuracy and data dependency. If dependency is of little importance, binomial and ITSM methods are accurate. Given the constraint of keeping the simulation within a range of plausible epidemiological curves faced by the surveillance system, our study confirms that our approach can be used to generate a large spectrum of outbreak signals.},

However, there is no commonly accepted classification system for the statistical methods used for event detection in syndromic surveillance. Comparing and choosing appropriate event detection algorithms is an increasingly challenging task. Although lists of selection criteria, and statistical methods used for signal detection have been reported, selection criteria are rarely linked to a specific set of appropriate statistical methods. The paper presents a practical approach for guiding surveillance practitioners to make an informed choice from among the most popular event detection algorithms based on the intended application of the algorithm. We developed selection criteria by mapping the assumptions and performance characteristics of event detection algorithms directly to important characteristics of the time series used in syndromic surveillance. We also considered types of epidemics that may be expected and other characteristics of the surveillance system. These guidelines will provide decisions makers, data analysts, public health practitioners, and researchers with a comprehensive but practical overview of the domain, which may reduce the technical barriers to the development and implementation of syndromic surveillance systems in animal and human health. The classification scheme was restricted to univariate and temporal methods because they are the most commonly used algorithms in syndromic surveillance.},

Evaluation studies demonstrated improved accuracy with more sophisticated methods, but these methods do not appear to be used widely in public health practice.},

	abstract = {The surveillance and preventions of infectious disease epidemics such as influenza and Ebola are important and challenging issues. It is therefore crucial to characterize the disease progress and epidemics process efficiently and accurately. Computational epidemiology can model the progression of the disease and its underlying contact network, but as yet lacks the ability to process of real-time and fine-grained surveillance data. Social media, on the other hand, provides timely and detailed disease surveillance but is insensible to the underlying contact network and disease model. To address these challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised neural network framework that integrates the strengths of computational epidemiology and social media mining techniques for influenza epidemiological modeling. Specifically, this framework learns social media users’ health states and intervention actions in real time, regularized by the underlying disease model and contact network. The learned knowledge from social media can then be fed into the computational epidemic model to improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diffusion modeling. We propose an online optimization algorithm that iteratively processes the above interactive learning process. The extensive experimental results provided demonstrated that our approach can not only outperform competing methods by a substantial margin in forecasting disease outbreaks, but also characterize the individual-level disease progress and diffusion effectively and efficiently.},

	abstract = {Disease surveillance is critical for mobilizing health care resources and deciding on isolation measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases. Because ground truth signals of rare and deadly diseases are sparse, it can be useful to enrich surveillance systems using measures of social and environmental factors which are known to influence the spread of a disease. One approach to measure such factors is by using real time news streams. In this study, we model the epidemiological transmission of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) disease during the outbreak that occurred from 2013 to 2018 in the Arabian peninsula. Using the GDELT news event database, we show that conflict related signals allow us to reconstruct the time series of newly infected cases per week. This reduces the residual sum of squared errors by a factor of 3.36 as compared to a standard epidemiological model. We also capture interpretable time-sensitive factors which illustrate the importance of using real time news stream to model the evolution of a disease such as MERS and facilitate early and effective policy interventions.},

	abstract = {The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has operated an emergency department syndromic surveillance system since 2001, using temporal and spatial scan statistics run on a daily basis for cluster detection. Since the system was originally implemented, a number of new methods have been proposed for use in cluster detection. We evaluated six temporal and four spatial/spatio-temporal detection methods using syndromic surveillance data spiked with simulated injections. The algorithms were compared on several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, coherence, and timeliness. We also evaluated each method’s implementation, programming time, run time, and the ease of use. Among the temporal methods, at a set specificity of 95\%, a Holt-Winters exponential smoother performed the best, detecting 19\% of the simulated injects across all shapes and sizes, followed by an autoregressive moving average model (16\%), a generalized linear model (15\%), a modified version of the Early Aberration Reporting System’s C2 algorithm (13\%), a temporal scan statistic (11\%), and a cumulative sum control chart ({\textless}2\%). Of the spatial/spatio-temporal methods we tested, a spatial scan statistic detected 3\% of all injects, a Bayes regression found 2\%, and a generalized linear mixed model and a space-time permutation scan statistic detected none at a specificity of 95\%. Positive predictive value was low ({\textless}7\%) for all methods. Overall, the detection methods we tested did not perform well in identifying the temporal and spatial clusters of cases in the inject dataset. The spatial scan statistic, our current method for spatial cluster detection, performed slightly better than the other tested methods across different inject magnitudes and types. Furthermore, we found the scan statistics, as applied in the SaTScan software package, to be the easiest to program and implement for daily data analysis.},

	abstract = {Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and bias of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time for Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but model predictions were increasingly unreliable at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making based on predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.},

	abstract = {Summary. Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},
